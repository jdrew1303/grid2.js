# Grid2.js
is a Node.js [npm-package][npm] / JavaScript implementation of two dimensional grid for collision detection. Exported for client side use with the help of [browserify][browserify].
It is a work in progress, look for the first stable release if interested.

## About
If there is a characteristic avarage size for objects in your applications two dimensional space, then using a fix grid for indexing objects spatial position can improve the performance of diverse calculations like field of view or collision detection.

## License
A quadtree is a scaling data structure for collision detection. You can find theory on the [WIKI][wiki].
